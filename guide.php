                DEFCON is the worlds largest computer hacking convention.
                Almost every major city of the world has a DEFCON-Group or DCGroup.
                So, DC8044 is a local DEFCON community in Kyiv, Ukraine.
                DC8044 meets at different local venues.
                Check the website or follow us for the latest information.
                There is no formal membership to DC8044.
                Show up to meetings, get involved remotely through chat,
                and join in on the conversation to be an ambassador of our community.
                Since most of us focus on web, mobile, network and systems security,
                you can anticipate some of that to begin with.
                However, many of us have other interests, like hardware hacking,
                CTFs and binary reversing/exploitation, so we'll also explore those areas as well.
                Since this is a community driven group, we'll allow the participants to
                figure out what interests them the most and steer the group in those directions.
